MQTT Dokuwiki template
======================

This is the [Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/) template for the [mqtt.org](http://mqtt.org) website [wiki](http://mqtt.org/wiki) pages.

It is intended to blend with the the theme of the overall site (which is based on Wordpress).

Currently it uses the pre-2012 Dokuwiki base template but it is in the progress of moving over to the responsive HTML5-based 2012-> template.
